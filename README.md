# Sparse Suffix Array with Minimizers
Implementation of Sparse Suffix Array with Minimizers - Project of CMSC701 - Computational Genomics

# Methods
## Lexicographical Minimizer
- The minimizer is defined as the lexicographically smallest k-mer in a window of size w.

## Randomized Minimizer
- The minimizer is defined based on a random order of k-mers.

## Frequency-based Minimizer
- The minimizer is defined based on the frequency of k-mers in a window of size w.
